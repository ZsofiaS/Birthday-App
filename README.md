# Birthday App
This is a challenge I did during my Week 3 at Makers Academy.
The app asks the user for a name and the birthday.
When the user submits the form, depending on the current date, the app will:
* wish the user happy birthday, or
* tell them how long they have to wait until their next birthday

## To run it
```
$ bundle
$ rackup
```
## To run the tests
```
$ rspec
```
